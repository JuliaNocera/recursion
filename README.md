#recursion
Working on recursion with traversing the DOM & stringifying input to translate to JSON (following all rules of JSON - ie. "null" return null)

This is a project I completed as a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta). This project was worked on with a pair.
